<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Here are some projects I’ve worked on:</p>
    <div class="project">
        <h2>Python Analysis on Loves Truck Stop Historical Spend Data</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of historical spend data from Loves Truck Stop to uncover patterns and insights that could inform pricing and operational strategies. The dataset was processed and analyzed using <strong>Pandas</strong> for data manipulation and transformation, and <strong>NumPy</strong> for efficient computation, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. The project specifically applied a <strong>Difference of Differences</strong> analysis, comparing a treatment group with a control group to evaluate the impact of certain operational changes. The computational demands of this analysis were handled efficiently using <strong>NumPy</strong>, which is well-suited for high-performance numerical calculations. To visualize the results and make them more accessible, <strong>Plotly</strong> was used for interactive data visualizations, allowing stakeholders to explore the data through dynamic charts and graphs. Additionally, <strong>mlxtend</strong> was utilized for <strong>Apriori analysis</strong>, which helped identify frequent itemsets and associations within the spend data, offering insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns. This combination of technologies enabled the project to derive actionable business insights from complex data in a timely and efficient manner.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>AWS Middleware Application for Data Synchronization</h2>
        <p>This AWS-hosted middleware application connected a <strong>Risk Management Platform API</strong> with a <strong>Vendor Management Platform</strong> to ensure synchronization of vendor profiles. The solution utilized <strong>AWS Step Functions</strong>, comprising <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> functions for specific transformations and validations. It integrated two platforms that communicated in different formats (JSON and XML), resolving the mismatches and ensuring seamless data synchronization through an API Gateway. The middleware was built to bridge the gap between these platforms, automating the synchronization process. The API Gateway exposed the middleware as a RESTful API, allowing communication with the external platforms. This project leveraged serverless architecture, utilizing AWS services to streamline development and reduce infrastructure overhead. The use of <strong>Lambda</strong> functions and <strong>Step Functions</strong> ensured that the solution was scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain, automating the synchronization of data between the two platforms.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Entity Resolution Solution with Python</h2>
        <p>This Python-based project focused on solving entity resolution challenges by clustering a large dataset using <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</strong> to reduce time complexity. After clustering, a <strong>rule-based Bayesian Entity Matching</strong> technique was applied to perform entity resolution. This approach used probabilistic models to assess the likelihood that two records referred to the same entity based on their attributes. The final step in the process involved applying <strong>fuzzy matching</strong> to refine the entity resolution process, especially for cases where records contained slight variations in spelling or formatting. This combination of techniques ensured that the final dataset was accurate, with duplicate records successfully merged and inconsistencies resolved. This solution significantly improved data quality for downstream analytics and reporting. The project used Python’s powerful libraries and techniques to handle large datasets and deliver clean, accurate data for further analysis.</p>
